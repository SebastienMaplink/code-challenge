According to commissioner James Gordon from [GCPD](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City_Police_Department), the cells showed no signs of break-in, and only a few playing cards were found.


_"During the night round some officers reported a strange stillness in the corridors of the maximum security block. They went to check and in their last radio report they said that some cells were empty, after that they did not respond anymore. This morning they were found near the cells raving and with a smile on their faces. Some playing cards was also found." - James Gordon_

Until now, there are no reports of occurrences related to the escape.
